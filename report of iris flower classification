Report
Problem Statement: The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into their correct species using their physical measurements.
Objective: To automate the process of species identification using data analysis and classification algorithms.
Scope: The project focuses on the well-known Iris dataset, exploring data visualization, classification techniques, and model evaluation. 
2. System Requirements
Hardware Requirements (typical examples):
Processor: i3 or higher
RAM: 2 GB or more
Storage: 5 GB of free space
Software Requirements (typical examples):
Operating System: Windows/Linux/macOS
Programming Language: Python (e.g., version 3.7.2)
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook or an IDE like VS Code 
3. Methodology
Data Collection: The project uses the Iris flower dataset, which contains 150 samples with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width (in cm).
Data Preprocessing: This involves loading the data, checking for missing values, and dividing it into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% train, 20% test).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data (e.g., using scatter plots or pair plots) to understand the relationships between features and how different species are separated.
Model Building: Training various machine learning models on the training data. Common algorithms include:
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM) 
4. Results and Evaluation
Model Performance: The report will present the accuracy of each trained model, often using metrics like the classification report and confusion matrix.
Key Findings: The Random Forest or KNN algorithms often achieve high accuracy (e.g., 97%) for this specific dataset. 
5. Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to a real-world classification problem. The chosen model effectively classifies Iris flowers, providing hands-on experience in data science and model deployment.
